Tested on: HP Spectre x360 Convertible 15-df1xxx Microsoft Windows 11

I plan to build a led circuit but instead of using a battery I will use the RP2040. I connect it to ground and the SDA1. I could use SCL1.

This is a very cool first project in circuit to understand how new components work.
Components:
•	Led, 
•	360 (Resistor)
•	Cable cords 
•	Breadboard.
I have all components needed.
